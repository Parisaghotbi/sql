**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

According to what I have learned from previous session, it is important to think about how we handle data in an ethical way. Data often represents real people, so we need to protect their privacy. For example, when we work with customer information, we should make sure personal details are hidden or kept safe. Following privacy rules like GDPR helps protect people's information and keeps it secure from unauthorized access or data leaks. This not only respects the privacy of individuals but also maintains trust in the way we manage data.

From an equity perspective, we should also be aware of how data might reflect or reinforce existing unfairness. If certain groups of people are left out of the data or not well-represented, the results might be biased. This could lead to unfair decisions. Going forward, it's important to ensure that data includes a wide range of people and does not unfairly disadvantage anyone. By checking for bias and making sure data is balanced, we can work toward more fair and inclusive outcomes in our analysis.
